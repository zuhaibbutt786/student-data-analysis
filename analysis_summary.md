## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that US airports are not evenly distributed across the country. There is a higher concentration in the eastern and western coastal regions, as well as in states with larger populations or geographic areas. Texas, California, and Alaska have the highest number of airports, reflecting their large size and economic importance. 

The majority of airports (55.6%) are located between 37.038°N and 54.162°N latitude, which corresponds to the northern part of the continental United States. Another significant portion (36.0%) falls between 19.914°N and 37.038°N, covering the southern continental US.

The interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive tool for exploring this data further, allowing users to visualize the geographic distribution of airports, analyze state-wise distribution, and examine the distribution by latitude and longitude.
